This is a list of files that have been manually reversed based on the available source code, or manually verified as being accurate.
If it's on this list and says complete, it's probably as close as we can get it to the original uncooked file.
If it says incomplete, reversing has started, but its not been finished
If its not on the list, assume it hasn't been reversed/verified yet. If you reverse/verify it, add it to the list please!

C++ Classes:
The following C++ classes have approximate method functionality generated by ChatGPT and edited by me.  These are typically for classes whose implementation is straightforward or can be derived easily through context.
All of these methods should be replaced by actual reverse-engineered code when possible. If you find a function that doesn't work, raise an issue.
If a class is listed, all its methods should be usable. If specific methods are listed in an incomplete class, they should be usable, even if others are not.
